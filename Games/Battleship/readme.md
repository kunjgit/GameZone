# Battleship

Battleship game built during week 4 of my software development course at \_nology.

Face against the computer in a daring game of chance as you attempt to locate and sink each other's ships.

Play on PC or mobile.

## Instructions

Please select your ships on your board, then press "Start Game" and place your first guess on the guess board.

The computer will then automatically take a guess on your board and then you can guess again.

The game ends when either your or your opponent's ships are fully sunk.

Note: The locations of the computer's ships are logged to the console when "Start Game" is pressed if you are curious.
