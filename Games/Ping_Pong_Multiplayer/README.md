## **Description 📃**
- Ping pong, also known as table tennis, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small solid rackets. 
- They must prevent the ball from touching the surface of the table on their side

## **How to play? 🕹️**
- Controls:
    - `W`: Up / `S`: Down (Player 1)
    - `↑`: Up / `↓`: Down (Player 2)
- Players must allow a ball played towards them to bounce once on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side. 
- A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. A player or team wins a game by scoring 11 points with a two-point margin. 
- A match is usually the best of any odd number of games (usually the best of five).
- This is a endless game, so both players can play as much as they want
