## **Description 📃**

Engaging two-player dice game where the objective is to be the first to reach a total score of 100 points. Players take turns rolling a die and accumulate points during their turn. The twist is that if a player rolls a 1, their current turn's score is reset to 0, and their turn ends. Players must strategize when to roll and when to hold to avoid losing points and give themselves the best chance to win.
