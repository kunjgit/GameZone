Make sure that the size is: **1280 px X 720 px.** \nThe frame should be such that there is only a single image of the game that's taking up the major portion of the frame. Any kind of text should not be there. \n **The design should be catchy and aesthetic!** 🔥 \n\n **Note:** You are not supposed to create any issue right now for the same. \nYou have to share different designs right now in ⁠[Discord](https://discord.gg/fgwk4XZfxG)  and Project Admin would be selecting one design and would be assigning the issue. After that only, you have to start working on it.`;
