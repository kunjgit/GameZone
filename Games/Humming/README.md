Humming
====

Play Roger the hummingbird in his quest for delicious nectar!

Roger is a very hungry hummingbird. He needs nectar, pronto.

Space bar: flap Roger's tiny wings. You will press this many many times

Arrow keys: move Roger

Tips:

- Roger needs to sip from the center of the flower. His tongue will flick out when he can feed

- Roger grows heavier the more he feeds

- Roger needs more energy to flap the higher he is
