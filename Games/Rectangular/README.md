Rectangular 13k
================

The goal is to make the red rectangle go through the red line in the right of the window using the arrow keys. Beware of black circles, if you touch one of them you will have to restart.
Use the space key to deploy your parachute and collect the red circles to "reload" it.
If you fall down the screen, the rectangle will reappear on the top, at the same place.

To start, press the "play" button.

Better with Chrome, works on other browsers but it seems to be really slow.

Enjoy !
