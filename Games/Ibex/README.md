Gameplay
---

You will have to use the 4 elements (Air, Earth, Fire, Water)
to make your animal progress safely in the environnment.

The 4 elements are primary elements but there are also secondary elements at play:
- The Volcano (creates fire)
- The Source (drops water)
- The Forest (created by Earth and Water)
- The Wind (left wind and right wind is created randomly in Air)

All elements interact with each other and the ibex also react to elements in different ways.

- Earth is a platform for the ibex
- Fire scares the ibex
- Water attracts the ibex
- Forest makes the ibex running faster
