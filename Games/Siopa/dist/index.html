A branch suddenly juts into the room as the tree is shifted by the tornado. The limb strikes you in the stomach. You topple backwards and touch your stomach.

Immediately, you close your mouth and stare at him, startled by the serene assurance and power in his eyes.</p> <p>"All will be well," he simply says. He points at the tornado.</p> <p>Turning, you look across the lawn just as the cyclone spirals above the tree grove. The winds spread out and fade away. Everything becomes tranquil.

He gingerly sets it down.</p> <p>"Come out," he tells you.</p> <p>Obeying his words, you climb the storm shelter steps and go outside.

Another screen gives you your bearings so you can navigate correctly. </t> <t name="wrapRope"> Noticing how unruly the sails are, you wrap the rope around the reel. You hope the boom won’t continue ricocheting back and forth over the cabin. </t> <t name="crankWinch"> You pull out the wrench and place it in the socket on top of the winch. With the added leverage, you are able to control the rope despite the heavy tension. </t></s><s id="belowDeck"> <p>You clutch the railing as you go down into the salon.

Rain pounds your face as you cling to the wheel and prepare to climb another wave. The crest is too far away. As the boat begins to flip backward, the boom crashes to one side. It knocks your shoulder, sending you flying over the railing. You plunge into the water. The salt stings your eyes as you see the boat rudder leave the water near your head. The boat flips and drifts away from you as the ocean sweeps you down the breaking wave. Sea water fills your lungs. It is vile and you want to spit it out, but you know that will only hasten the inevitable. Your limbs begin to feel cold as you are tossed below the water. The surface is far away.

A large wave hits the starboard side. The boat rolls and you are knocked against the wall. An awful shattering sound rends the air. Bracing yourself against the salon table, you look around. The front of the boat is splintered and a jagged cliff face juts into the cabin. Another wave strikes the boat and you are flung against the rock. You hit your head and something warm and sticky oozes down over your ear. Water begins filling the cabin as the walls begin to split.

He studies you for a moment as you stare with wide eyes at him.</p> <p>A compassionate smile lights up his features as he asks you, "Have you so little faith?"</p> <p>Unable to respond to his question, you merely gawk at him as he walks unperturbedly toward the front of the boat. He raises his arms and the violent gales cease. The waters grow calm and you can see the string of islands you were sailing around.

Taking your hand, he leads you above deck.</p> <p>"Be still," he commands the boisterous gales and lashing waves.</p> <p>To your utter amazement, the storm immediately halts.

The carpet makes a sickening scream as the concrete below it pushes up through the tough fibers. Skidding to a halt, you are thrown forward. Filing cabinets line the nearby wall. One tips as the uneven floor shatters beneath it. You have just enough time to put your hands up to guard your head before the heavy metal case crashes against you. Now pinned to the floor, you realize your arm is broken. Pain grips your mind. Looking around, you notice a jagged aperture travel up the wall and across the ceiling. The roof begins <e>to crumble<c eval="complete('earth')">Continue</c></e>.</p></s><s id="outsideOfficeDeath"> <p>To your horror, the ground around you rises and falls like ocean waves. Letting out a terrible sigh, the ground suddenly bursts. Backing away, you duck behind the trees surrounding the bench. Dust covers you. Spitting, you try to get the sediment out of your mouth as you rub your eyes and smear more dirt into your skin. Something rumbles nearby. Looking up, you see the hill by your office building roll forward. Trees, buildings, and anything in its path are demolished and carried with it. Turning, you start running as quickly as you can, but the earth soon casts a shadow over your form. The landslide rushes toward you. Sunlight disappears as black, brown, and gray soil drops <e>around you<c eval="complete('earth')">Continue</c></e>.</p></s><s id="inOfficeLife"> <p>A shockwave ripples through the office. You collide with the wall, but manage to stay upright. The glass wall shatters as another tremor strikes the building. Managing to avoid the falling glass, you scamper down the hallway. The floor suddenly buckles, tossing you to the ground. You look up as a heavy filing cabinet tips forward. You throw your arms up to protect your face from the inevitable impact, but nothing happens. You look up. A stranger has his back against the cabinet, preventing it from falling on you.</p> <p>"I will protect you," the stranger tells you.</p> <p>The man gives you a warm, inviting smile and extends his hand to you. You gape at the outstretched hand while your heart thunders in your chest.</p> <p><e>All is still. <c goto="end">Continue</c> </e></p></s><s id="outsideOfficeLife"> <p>The land ruptures and convulses as you stumble behind the bench. Coughing and gasping in the dusty air, you finally see the trees and duck behind them for protection. Something that sounds like an avalanche rends the air. Frantically, you look around and see that the nearby hill is rolling forward. You begin sprinting, but the crusty mound is faster than you. Soon, a shadow passes over your head. You trip and are sent sprawling on the asphalt. Looking back, you see the ground tower above you. You also notice a figure step between you and the oncoming landslide.</p> <p>"Trust me," the stranger tells you as he notices the fear flood your eyes.</p> <p>The man raises his arms. The land not only stops but retreats to where it came from originally. Your body tingles, but these new feelings do not arise from the earthquake. The man turns and looks directly into your eyes.</p> <p><e>All is still. <c goto="end">Continue</c> </e></p></s> <script>"use strict";function Siopa(startID){var siopa=this;this.sBox=document.createElement("div"),this.sBox.id="sBox",document.body.appendChild(this.sBox),this.states={},this.currentScene=null,document.body.addEventListener("click",function(event){var element=event.target;if(siopa.clearMenu(),"e"==element.tagName.toLowerCase()){for(var cs=element.getElementsByTagName("c"),menu=document.createElement("eMenu"),i=0;i<cs.length;i++){var c=cs[i];if(siopa.isActionActive(c)){var item=document.createElement("eMenuItem");item.c=c,item.innerHTML=c.innerHTML,menu.appendChild(item)}}document.body.appendChild(menu);var menuRect=menu.getBoundingClientRect();menu.style.left=Math.floor(event.clientX-.5*menuRect.width)+"px",menu.style.top=Math.floor(event.clientY)+"px",siopa.menu=menu}if("emenuitem"==element.tagName.toLowerCase()){var c=element.c,evalCode=c.getAttribute("eval");if(evalCode){var result=eval(evalCode);if(result===!1)return}for(var show=c.getAttribute("show"),texts=siopa.sBox.getElementsByTagName("t"),i=0;i<texts.length;i++)texts[i].style.display=texts[i].getAttribute("name")==show?"block":"none";var turnon=c.getAttribute("turnon");if(turnon)for(var ons=turnon.split(" "),i=0;i<ons.length;i++)siopa.states[ons[i]]=!0;var turnoff=c.getAttribute("turnoff");if(turnoff)for(var offs=turnoff.split(" "),i=0;i<offs.length;i++)siopa.states[offs[i]]=!1;siopa.updateEntityColors();var to=c.getAttribute("goto");to&&siopa.activateScene(to)}}),document.body.addEventListener("keydown",function(e){27==e.keyCode&&siopa.clearMenu()}),this.activateScene(startID)}function load(){siopa=new Siopa("start")}function beginAir(e){var t="Death";e&&(t="Life"),siopa.activateScene("livingRoom"),setTimeout(function(){siopa.activateScene("porch"===siopa.currentScene?"outside"+t:"stormShelter"===siopa.currentScene?"shelter"+t:"inside"+t)},6e4)}function beginWater(e){var t="Death";e&&(t="Life"),siopa.activateScene("onDeck"),setTimeout(function(){siopa.activateScene("onDeck"===siopa.currentScene?"onDeck"+t:"belowDeck"+t)},6e4)}function beginFire(e){var t="Death";e&&(t="Life"),fireSave=e,siopa.activateScene("inTent"),fireTimer=setTimeout(function(){siopa.activateScene("driving"===siopa.currentScene?"jeep"+t:"smoke"+t)},6e4)}function explodeJeep(){clearTimeout(fireTimer),siopa.activateScene(fireSave?"jeepLife":"jeepDeath")}function beginEarth(e){var t="Death";e&&(t="Life"),siopa.activateScene("inCubical"),setTimeout(function(){siopa.activateScene("inCubical"===siopa.currentScene||"hallway"===siopa.currentScene?"inOffice"+t:"outsideOffice"+t)},6e4)}function complete(e){siopa.states[e+"Complete"]=!0,siopa.states.completedOne=!0,siopa.states.airComplete&&siopa.states.waterComplete&&siopa.states.fireComplete&&siopa.states.earthComplete?siopa.activateScene("selectionFinal"):(document.getElementById("prompt").innerHTML="Select another element:",siopa.activateScene("selection"))}Siopa.prototype.activateScene=function(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);this.sBox.innerHTML=t.innerHTML,this.currentScene=e,this.updateEntityColors(),this.clearMenu()},Siopa.prototype.isActionActive=function(e){var t=e.getAttribute("on");if(t&&!this.states[t])return!1;var i=e.getAttribute("off");return i&&this.states[i]?!1:!0},Siopa.prototype.updateEntityColors=function(){for(var e=this.sBox.getElementsByTagName("e"),t=0;t<e.length;t++){for(var i=e[t],n=i.getElementsByTagName("c"),a=!1,o=0;o<n.length;o++){var s=n[o];if(this.isActionActive(s)){a=!0;break}}i.className=a?"":"inactive"}},Siopa.prototype.clearMenu=function(){if(this.menu){try{document.body.removeChild(this.menu)}catch(e){}this.menu=null}};var siopa;window.addEventListener?window.addEventListener("load",load):window.attachEvent&&window.attachEvent("onload",load);var fireTimer,fireSave; </script> </body></html>
