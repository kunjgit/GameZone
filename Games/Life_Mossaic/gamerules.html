      <h2>Life's Mosaic</h2>
      <p>
        Life's Mosaic, or simply "Life," is a cellular automaton devised
        by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player
        game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state,
        requiring no further input. Players interact with the game by creating
        an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. The game is
        Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other
        Turing machine.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>The Universe</h2>
      <p>
        The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional
        orthogonal grid of square cells, Each cell is in one of two possible
        states, ALIVE or DEAD. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors,
        which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
        adjacent.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by
          underpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
          generation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
          overpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell,
          as if by reproduction.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The first generation is created by applying the above rules
        simultaneously to every cell in the seed, alive or dead; births and
        deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this
        happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function
        of the preceding one.

      <h2>The Presets</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Glider</h3>
        <p>
          The glider is the smallest, most common, and first-discovered
          spaceship in Game of Life. It travels diagonally across the grid.
          Gliders are important because they are easily produced (by glider guns
          and rakes), can be collided with each other to form more complicated
          patterns, and can be used to transmit information over long distances.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Big Glider</h3>
        <p>
          The big glider was found by Dean Hickerson in December 1989 and was
          the first known diagonal spaceship other than the glider. Two gliders
          can be temporarily seen at the front of the ship; these do not stay
          gliders but still move like them.

      <div>
        <h3>Gosper Glider Gun</h3>
        <p>
          The Gosper glider gun is the first known gun, and indeed the first
          known finite pattern with unbounded growth, found by Bill Gosper in
          November 1970. It consists of two queen bee shuttles stabilized by two
          blocks.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Life's Mosaic Life is a fascinating exploration of life, death, and
        the rules that govern them. Despite its simplicity, it can lead to
        complex and beautiful patterns.Life's Mosaic offers a unique way to
        explore the unpredictable beauty of life itself.
