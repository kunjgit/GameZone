## **Description 📃**

- The Simon game is a classic memory game that requires players to follow a sequence of colors and sounds to advance to higher levels. In this version built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, players are presented with a game board consisting of four colored buttons - green, red, yellow, and blue.

## **Functionalities 🎮**

- The game starts with a sequence of colors played by the computer, and players must repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons in the correct order. The game progressively gets more difficult with longer and more complex sequences. The game includes features such as a level counter, a highest score tracker, and a play button.
