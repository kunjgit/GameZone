Life of Blobb
================================

A canvas-based game.It's hard being a blob -- there is always a bigger blob who may consume you. Even if you outgrow everyone, this doesn't mean that you will succeed - you need to be quick and fit to get through life. And in the end, it all depends on luck, doesn't it?
