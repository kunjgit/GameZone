# **Ludo game 🎮** 
<br>

## **Description 📃** 
Ludo is a classic board game where players race to move their tokens from the starting area to the home area by rolling a die. It combines luck and strategy as players aim to block opponents while advancing their own tokens. The first player to get all their tokens home wins the game. It's a fun and engaging game for all ages.

## **Functionalities 🎮** 
- Game Modes: Players can choose from different game modes such as single-player against computer opponents, local multiplayer with friends on the same device, or online multiplayer with players from around the world.

- Multiplayer Support: The game allows multiple players to participate simultaneously, either on a single device or through online connectivity.


- Dice Rolling: The game includes a virtual dice that can be rolled with a simple tap or click. The dice roll generates a random number to determine the number of spaces a player can move their token.

- Token Movement: Players can select and move their tokens by tapping or dragging them across the board. The movement follows the rules of the traditional Ludo game, with tokens moving clockwise and capturing opponent's tokens when landing on the same space.

- Capturing and Sending Back Tokens: When a player's token lands on a space occupied by an opponent's token, the digital version can automatically capture and send back the opponent's token to their starting area.
