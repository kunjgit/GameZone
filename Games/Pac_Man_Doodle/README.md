# Pac-Man Game


## Description 📃

Pac-Man is a classic arcade game where players control a character named Pac-Man to navigate through a maze filled with dots and avoid ghost enemies. The objective is to eat all the dots in the maze while avoiding the ghosts. Power pellets are available to temporarily turn the tables, allowing Pac-Man to eat the ghosts. The game ends when all the dots are eaten, or when a ghost captures Pac-Man.
