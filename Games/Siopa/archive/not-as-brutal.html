	<p>You quickly run down the steps. A collection of water bottles are gathered

	<p>Pressure builds inside the room. Frightened, you flee to the nearby

	splinters, flying through the air around you. One of the walls of the
	closet collapses. You try to scoot away and use a jacket as a shield, but
	plaster hits you on the head. As your eyes slowly close, you see the

	is moving too quickly. You stumble, loose your footing, and realize you are
	no longer on the ground. Trying to breathe, you are flung through the air

	There is an awful ripping sound all around you. As you look up at the
	entrance, a tree strikes the storm shelter and causes the walls around the
	door to buckle. The wind whips around the tree, shifting it. A branch
	suddenly juts into the room as the tree is shifted by the tornado. The limb
	strikes you in the stomach. You topple backwards and touch your stomach.
	When you remove your hand it is covered in scarlet. Your surroundings begin

	<p>Surprised and shocked, your jaw drops open as he takes your hand and leads
	you outside. The intense winds rip at your clothing as the tornado gets

	<p>"All will be well," he simply says. He points at the tornado.</p>

	<p>Turning, you look across the lawn just as the cyclone spirals above the

	standing there. There is a sickening ripping sound as something is torn out
	of the ground. As you watch, the man raises his arms and he catches the
	trunk of a full-grown tree. He gingerly sets it down.</p>

	<p>"Come out," he tells you.</p>

	<p>Obeying his words, you climb the storm shelter steps and go outside. The

	A flame reaches forward and consumes the back of your vehicle. The sounds

	<p>"Come to me," he says, beckoning to you with his arm.</p>

	<p>You hesitate as you notice the flames around him, but then cough and wheeze

	<p>"Trust me to drive," the man suddenly tells you.</p>

	<p>Assured by his calm tone, you break the jeep and let him have the
