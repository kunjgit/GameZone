## **Description 📃**
- This puzzle can be solved in 1024 movements.
- Great Sokoban Style game with some beautifully minimalist 3D graphics and animations.
- Very well designed puzzles and challenging.
- Definitely you gonna enjoy playing through all the stages on this one. 
- That is to say, I think it is not possible to do it in less than 1024 movements.
